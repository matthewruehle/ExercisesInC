# Exercise 2
## Pointers


1.  Read `stack.c`, which should be in this directory.  What is it
intended to do?  What would the output be if the program worked as
expected?
	- This program looks like it means to make an array of size SIZE, all entries of which have value 42, and then prints it out - it is meant to return [42, 42, 42, 42, 42].

2.  Compile it.  Do you get a warning?  What does it mean?
	- The compiler states that the return is an address of a local variable - so, that local variable might point to something other than the desired array if anything uses more memory.

3.  Run it.  What happens?  Can you explain it?  You might find it
helpful to draw a stack diagram.
	- The execution prints the array from bar(), because bar's array uses the now-"free" memory originally allocated to foo()'s array.


4.  Comment out the `print` statements in `foo()` and `bar()` and run
it again.  What happens now?
	- The function prints two zeroes, followed by three large numbers which change between run - suggesting they are either memory addresses or some intermediary value for a different process. This is likely because the location of *array, the local variable, was no longer "reserved" in memory once foo() completed.


5.  Add comments to the code to explain these experiments and the results,
then check the code in to the repo.

Moral: Don't return pointers to stack allocated data!
