Reflection 0 - Software Systems, S17 - Matt Ruehle

The team formation process was based in part off of shared interests - a goal of learning how servers are developed - and in part off of experience having worked with some of the teammates before. The individual goals were shared during the "wandering from topic to topic, discussing" phase - during which the notion of making a server from scratch sounded relevant to several peoples' goals.

Team goals are not yet set in stone, and will likely be revised once we finish a preperatory reading on network programming (self-assigned for 1/26); task-setting for the sprint backlog has thus just been various readings. More "actionable" goals will come after we have a better idea of what parts our project will need.

Our selection of scrum master was based chiefly on none of us having a strong interest, and Bonnie volunteering; other responsibilities are being allocated as we go, since none of us have significant prior C experience.

I remain apprehensive about programming a server, mainly because as of yet I still have only a vague notion of what a server _is_, in a low-level software sense.
